  - Add new option glance::backend::swift::swift_store_large_object_chunk_size
    The swift_store_large_object_chunk_size is to be used in conjunction with
    swift_store_large_object_size.
    While swift_store_large_object_size is the trigger for glance to start
    chunking images, swift_store_large_object_chunk_size is the size of the
    chunks.
